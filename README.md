Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. 

Very cool to understand simple API functions and understanding how the data is represented. For the random function, the data is returned as an array of objects. Once I figured that out, I used previous array experience to successfully pull the data needed for the page.
